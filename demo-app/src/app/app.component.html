<p>
  fuzz-js is an open source fuzzy string searching library written in JavaScript.
  It finds imperfect string matches inside a given array of objects.
</p>
<p>
  I was motivated to build fuzz-js because I found it difficult to understand the algorithms behind other popular libraries.
  The matches that showed up were sometimes difficult to explain.
</p>
<p>
  The demo below helps visualize the scoring process of fuzz-js.
  I hope it will keep the workings of fuzz-js transparent.
