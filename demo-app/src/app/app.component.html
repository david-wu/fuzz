<p>
  fuzz-js is an open source fuzzy string searching library written in JavaScript.
  It finds imperfect string matches inside a given array of objects.

<h3># How scoring works</h3>
<p>
  Scoring is based on "edit distance" or how many operations it takes to transform one string into the other.  At the bottom of the search demo, there is a tab labeled "Fuzzalytics".
  When you select a row, a colored grid shows up in that tab.
</p>
<p>
  The first grid is the operation matrix.
  The query string is displayed down the left hand side of the grid, and the subject string is displayed along the top.
  The cells marked "o" are the operations taken to change the query string into the subject string.

<p>
  These operations have some cost associated with them.  You can view the scores as operations as made by clicking on the "View Scores" button.

<h3># Installing</h3>
<pre class="code"><code>npm install --save fuzz-js</code></pre>

<h3># Usage</h3>
<p>The "filter" function filters out objects that do not pass the fuzz test.</p>
<pre class="code"><code>{{ codeBlocks.howToUse }}</code></pre>

<h3># Advanced Usage</h3>
<p>
  The "search" function returns additional search information.
  This includes the key of the matched string, edit distance, and a styled string based on the match ranges.
</p>
<p>
  The "search" function also accepts an options object for customizing the search.
  To try out different options, go to the "Search Options" tab in the demo above.
</p>
<p>
  If subjectKeys is not provided, the default behavior is to search all (deep) values within the object.
